How to get access to the Lookit staging server - CDS workshop participants
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Lookit "staging server" is a separate instance of the platform from the "production server" where actual studies take place. This is where we try out new features, and it also serves as a "sandbox" environment where you can learn to create and manage studies without worrying about handling actual participant data.

We will be playing with an example study during the hands-on Lookit workshop at the CDS Open Developmental Data preconference, so setting up an account ahead of time will make things go more smoothly.

1. Go to the `staging OSF server <https://staging.osf.io>`_. Click 'Sign Up' at the top right and create an account. This is your "staging-OSF account." It's separate from your regular OSF account, if you have one. You'll use the staging OSF account to log in to the Lookit staging server.

2. Go to `<https://staging-lookit.cos.io/exp/>`_. Click the "Open Science Framework" link. Log in with your staging-OSF account from step 1.

3. If you have not previously logged in to Lookit (or Lookit staging), you should now see a message that 'Your request to join Experimenter has been submitted. You will receive a notification by email when this is completed.' Approval is easy but currently manual. But in any event, you will get approval before the workshop at CDS!

4. Once your request is approved, you can return to `<https://staging-lookit.cos.io/exp/>`_ to log in. You should now see a "Manage Studies" page. Bookmark this address!
