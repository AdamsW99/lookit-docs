Accessing Lookit and community
######################################

To get started, you need to get on Lookit! 

Step 1: Join the Lookit Slack workspace
----------------------------------------
Click `here <https://join.slack.com/t/lookit-mit/shared_invite/enQtNzU4MDAzNjYwMTAwLTZhNDM0NzU2MGMxZWNhZjcxZDU1ZWUyYzIzZjlkM2UyNTRiZjkyZmEwZjMxOGVmMDM3ZmNlNzMwM2Q5NTYwODU>`_ to join the Lookit Slack workspace. If you haven't used Slack before, you'll need to create an account; otherwise it will be added to your other workspaces. 

Slack is a messaging platform that serves as the primary tool for communicatation about development and use of the Lookit platform. The Lookit Slack workspace is essentially a collection of "chat rooms" for various topics. You can use Slack via a web interface, a desktop app, and/or on your phone. 

Step 2: Get access to the staging server
----------------------------------------
The Lookit "staging server" is a separate instance of the platform from the "production server" where actual studies take place. This is where we try out new features, and it also serves as a "sandbox" environment where you can learn to create and manage studies without worrying about handling actual participant data. 

1. Go to the `staging OSF server <https://staging.osf.io>`_. Click 'Sign Up' at the top right and create an account. This is your "staging-OSF account." It's separate from your regular OSF account, if you have one. You'll use the staging OSF account to log in to the Lookit staging server.

2. Go to `<https://staging-lookit.cos.io/exp/>`_. Click the "Open Science Framework" link. Log in with your staging-OSF account from step 1.

3. If you have not previously logged in to Lookit (or Lookit staging), you should now see a message that 'Your request to join Experimenter has been submitted. You will receive a notification by email when this is completed.' **Send a private message (PM) to Kim on Slack** once you have requested access so we can approve you promptly! New researchers require approval to access Lookit, which is easy but not automatic.

4. Once your request is approved, you can return to `<https://staging-lookit.cos.io/exp/>`_ to log in. You should now see a "Manage Studies" page. Bookmark this address!

Where to go for help
---------------------
If you need help as you're completing this tutorial - or later when you're creating and running studies on Lookit - here's where to go:

- The 'researchers' or 'tech support' **Slack channels** in the Lookit workspace. First search to see if someone has asked the same question before! If not, post in one of these channels to get support from Lookit staff and/or other researchers who may have dealt with the same issue. (If you need help specifically from Lookit staff, feel free to add `@Kim` to your post to tag Kim, but under almost all circumstances the question should still go in one of the public channels rather than a private chat, so that other people can see the answers.)

  Even if you're not totally stumped, it's worth checking in on Slack to get ideas and resources! For example, you might ask if anyone has an R script for analyzing their data that you could use as a starting point, or run a draft debriefing by other researchers to get advice on wording.


- **Tutorial office hours** with Lookit staff will be held via Google Hangouts. You can find the schedule below and in `this Google calendar <https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=bGtuc3Y4b3RidTUzMzNxdTBtaGRxMGI3bmdAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ>`_. Drop in any time during office hours to ask a question as you work through the tutorial.

Exercises
----------

1. Say hello in the "general" channel of the Lookit Slack workspace.

2. Get a feel for the participant experience! Go to the main participant-facing portion of the staging server, https://staging-lookit.cos.io. Go to 'Studies,' select the study called 'Example study,' and participate in it! You'll be prompted to complete the demographic survey and register at least one child before you can start. We recommend making up responses and not using your real personal information on the staging server, as many researchers will have access to it and it is NOT treated as actual data (with all the care that entails). E.g., please don't enter your kids' actual birthdays or health info.

3. [Extra credit] If you have young kids, take part in a currently-running study on the production server - the experience is different with a squirming kid in your lap! Create an account on the production server by going to https://lookit.mit.edu and clicking 'Sign up.' So that you can later make a researcher account, use a *different* email account to register than you use for your regular OSF account, if you have one. For instance, use a personal instead of work email. Please enter actual, not made-up, data on the production server - you are participating in real research here.
